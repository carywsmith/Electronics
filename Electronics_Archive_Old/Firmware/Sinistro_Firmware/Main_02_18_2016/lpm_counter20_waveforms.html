<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file lpm_counter20.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design lpm_counter20.v. The design lpm_counter20.v is a 4 bit down counter. The counter supports a synchronous load of data input. The counter has an asynchronous set signal, that sets the counter to 7. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The output port cout will be asserted at the completion of count sequence. The ports cin and cout are used to chain multiple counters together. </P>
