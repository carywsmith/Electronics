<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_counter46.tdf" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_counter46.tdf". The design "lpm_counter46.tdf" is a 7 bit up modulus 80 counter. The counter has an asynchronous clear input. </P>
